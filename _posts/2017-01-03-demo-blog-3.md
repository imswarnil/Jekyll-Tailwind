## What is WordPress? 💻

Ah yes, WordPress — the web’s equivalent of that one friend who does *everything*. Blogs? Sure. E-commerce? Yep. Membership sites, forums, portfolios? Done. Done. And done.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque vel urna a arcu ullamcorper varius nec non leo. Vivamus in lorem vitae nulla egestas faucibus.

### Features That Made It King 👑

- Thousands of themes and plugins
- Massive community and support
- Easy to set up, even for beginners
- Powers 40%+ of the internet (including your uncle’s conspiracy blog)

### The Plugin Dilemma

> “With great power comes great plugin conflicts.”

Too many plugins and it becomes a laggy Frankenstein. But treat it right, and it’s a digital palace.

### TL;DR Vibes:

WordPress is like LEGO — infinitely flexible, occasionally painful to step on.
