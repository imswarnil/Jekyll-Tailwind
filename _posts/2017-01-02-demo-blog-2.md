## What is Ghost? 👻

Ghost is not your grandma’s CMS. It's an open-source publishing platform built for modern creators — clean, fast, and zero fluff.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer nec odio. Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam.

### Why Choose Ghost?

- **Minimalist UI** that feels like zen mode.
- **Markdown-first** writing experience.
- **Built-in SEO** and newsletter tools.
- **No plugins, no chaos**, just pure publishing.

> “It’s like WordPress went on a silent meditation retreat and came back better.”

### Use Cases

- Blogging 📝
- Newsletters 📬
- Personal portfolios 🎨
- Docs, zines, even weird creative experiments 🌌

### TL;DR Vibes:

If WordPress is a Swiss Army knife, Ghost is a samurai sword — clean, sharp, and deadly fast.
