hero_bio: |
  I'm a **Salesforce CRM Analytics Developer** with over **5 years of experience** in the tech industry. I specialize in building data-driven solutions that help businesses make better decisions.

  My journey in tech began with web development, where I learned the fundamentals of programming and user experience design. Over time, I developed a passion for data analytics and visualization, which led me to specialize in Salesforce CRM Analytics (formerly Einstein Analytics).

  When I'm not coding or creating content, you can find me hiking, reading, or experimenting with new technologies. I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and helping others grow in their tech careers.
